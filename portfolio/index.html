        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Joy Njeri â€” a front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, currently sharpening my skills through the ALX Software Engineering Program. My journey began with a passion for creativity, which I express through design, writing, and professional music. I bring a unique blend of technical skill and artistic vision to every project. Whether I am building responsive user interfaces, solving real-world problems with code, or composing music, I am driven by curiosity, excellence, and purpose. Beyond tech, I enjoy reading, journaling, and engaging in projects that inspire connection and growth.</p>
